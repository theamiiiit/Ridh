I’m terrible at keeping secrets, so I figured I should just tell you:
I really like you. Honestly, you had my attention from the very first day.

Since then, that feeling has only grown. I really care about you, and I can’t help but wonder what "us" would look like.
I would love the chance to explore that and see where this could go.

You’re incredible, and I just wanted you to know how I see you.`;
